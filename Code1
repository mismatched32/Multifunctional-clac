In Algebra, X often refers to the unknown number in an equation. To find the value of x we use algebra rules to get to x = [some number]. SymPy is a Python library to work with symbolic math. The following code works to solve an equation set equal to zero. Run the code and remember to use Python syntax to enter an equation (with "x" as the variable) and see the solution.

import sympy
from sympy import symbols
from sympy.solvers import solve

x = symbols('x')

eq = input('Enter an equation to solve for x: 0 = ')
print(len(solve(eq,x)))
print("x = ", solve(eq,x)[0])


# Only change code above this line
import math_code_test_a as test
test.step27(In[-1].split('# Only change code above this line')[0])
